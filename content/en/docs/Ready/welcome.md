Dear reader,

Congratulations! I presume that you’re reading this *ICSS Sotong Guide* because you’ve received an offer to study at Imperial College London. It cannot be understated how much of an achievement it is to be in this position - *kudos* to you for your hard work!

I recall the months preceding my first year at Imperial. I was excited to experience different cultures, meet new people and see what the world had to offer, all in a completely new environment, over 10,000km away from *home*. Similarly, your first foray into university life overseas can be a daunting one filled with myriads of challenges and endless possibilities. I’m sure you must be very excited!

London, while vibrant and exciting, comes with its fair share of unfamiliarities. The cold North Acton winds, the more-frequent-than-appreciated Tube strikes and astronomical food prices are truly experiences to behold. You will find that London is very different from Singapore - and that adjusting will take time. I hope that in this unfamiliarity, you forge new belongings and friendships to help you find your *Home Away from Home*.

As I close my first year at Imperial, I find myself reflecting on the personal growth I’ve experienced. Living independently, surviving winter and house-hunting are things that perhaps only the international student experience can offer a Singaporean in their early twenties. That is precisely why I’ve loved studying here thus far. I hope you do too!

The *ICSS Sotong Guide* is a pre-departure resource lovingly prepared and updated by your fellow international students from Singapore. We recognise that moving to a new country (alone, for that matter) can be very overwhelming - we were all in your shoes once. Having gone through and learned from our own past experiences, we figured that having a guide like this would go a long way for new students.

The ICSS Committee has worked hard to fact-check and verify all information within the *Sotong Guide*. However, if anything looks amiss or you have any clarifications regarding any pointers, please feel free to contact me (@jaamestaay on Telegram) or any of the ICSS Committee members (details found in Section 2!). Corrections are always welcome!

We hope this guide will be largely beneficial and a reliable companion from the beginning of your packing and preparation in Singapore to your eventual life here in London.

President, 41st Executive Committee
