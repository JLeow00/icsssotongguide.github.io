The Imperial College Singapore Society (ICSS) is a student-led organisation steeped in rich culture and tradition. It is one of the oldest and largest Singaporean communities outside the UK, boasting more than 250 members yearly.

# Why ICSS?

While moving abroad can be very exciting, it definitely comes with its fair share of academic and non-academic challenges. Perhaps the biggest challenge of all is the possible lack of a support system, especially when you first arrive in London.

As a member of ICSS, you are part of a family where you can expect support from seniors and peers. We hope that the familiarity of other Singaporeans can help to allay the struggles you might face and build part of your *Home Away from Home* whilst studying here at Imperial.

ICSS organises many events throughout the academic year in an effort to do just that. We have a multitude of events planned, from smaller-scale events like the *Hyde Park Picnic* to our flagship events such as the annual *ICSS Ski Trip* and *Major Event*. You are sure to find events that youâ€™d enjoy here at ICSS, all while enjoying the company of your fellow Singaporeans studying overseas.

On top of that, the society organises a range of initiatives to enhance your experience here at Imperial. Be sure to look out for sporting events, subsidised musical performances, exciting career events and many more!
