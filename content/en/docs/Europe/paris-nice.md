## Recommended Places to Eat

### La Merenda (Nice)

Local recommended this place to me. Chef was a 2 starred Michelin chef that decided to go back to cooking instead of expediting and take over this small restaurant. Super small joint (25 seats) and reservations are recommended (go a day before/at lunch for dinner). There’s a 7pm and 8.30pm timeslot and if you’re lucky you can book for the latter if you appear at 7pm. French Nicoise food.

### La Voix de son Maitre (Nice)

Known for their crepes! It’s crisp and pretty decent!

### Chez Pipo (Nice)

Get the socca from here! It’s a chickpea pancake that’s a speciality in Nice i think.

### Petisserie Rivieria (Monaco)

If you’re a bread fanatic, head here and get a Tresse, a brioche stuffed with almond cream. It’s absolutely LIFE CHANGING. They only bake one of these a day. It’s about 1.5 foot long so it’s best if you share (or you can just eat it yourself).

### Du Pain et des Idees (Paris)

Pistachio and chocolate snail pastry is the BEST, absolutely loved it.

### Frenchie to Go (Paris)

French toast is REALLY good, smoked bacon and maple syrup scone also the bomb though it’s really small.

Macarons are good! Not overly sweet.

## Tips

The last Ryanair flight of the day (which is often the cheapest) has quite a high likelihood of being cancelled. It’s happened to me and a bunch of friends who went on a separate occasion too. If you’ve something important on the next day, consider buying an earlier flight.  

Try to wait for a Eurostar sale before going to Paris because it can go for as low as 25-35 quid one way and it’s so much more convenient than taking a plane/bus there.  

If you want photos without the crowd, wake up early and head to the attractions!  

Beware of and stay away from gangs of conmen (e.g. people coming up to you and tying friendship bands on your hand).  

Beware of pickpocket (usually on metro).  

Beware of people coming up to you to sign “petitions”, you might be pickpocketed while getting distracted.  

Going up to the Eiffel tower around sunset might be the best idea, you can see both the day and night skyline with just one ticket.  

You’ll probably get the best view of the Eiffel tower from the Palais de Chailot.
