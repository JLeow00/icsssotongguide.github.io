## Recommended Places to Eat

### Bologna 

Try the fresh egg pastas (tagliatelle al ragu/lasagne) as they’re really known for it and try mortadella and prosciutto, it tastes much better in Bologna!  

[More Information →](https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Restaurants-g187801-zfd10678-Bologna_Province_of_Bologna_Emilia_Romagna-Pasta.html)

### San Martino Gastromania (Monterosso)

Super small joint, pastas were good! Pansotti with walnut sauce left a mark.

### All'antico Vanaio (Florence)

Best sandwiches you can get around. There’re 3 outlets but they all belong to the same chain and are all equally good.  

Grab any sandwich with the truffle sauce!

### Trattoria Sergio Gozzi (Florence)

Pretty cheap and good, most dishes come in smaller plates so you can have more variety for the same price.

### Pizzeria da Remo (Rome)

Roman (thin crust, crisp) pizzas for a good price considering their size. Fiori di zucca (starter) was pretty good too.

## Tips

Italy gets slightly more dangerous as you move further down South so do take good care of your belongings (no matter where you go tbh).  

For paid Museums and Attractions, buy tickets online to skip the queue.  

Be aware of thieves and keep your luggage with you while taking trains.  

When using cash, check for counterfeit notes when receiving change.  

There’s plenty of water fountains with drinkable water on the streets of Italy, top up your water bottle on the go; it’s rude to ask for tap water while dining in restaurants. Tap water is generally not served in restaurants anyway.  

Try Dishes unique to each region!  

| Region  | Dishes  |
|---|---|
| Florence  | Florentine Steak, Panini  |
| Rome  | Carbonara, Alfredo, Arrabiata Pasta  |
| Amalfi Coast  | Limoncello and anything made from Amalfi Lemons  |
| Naples  | Neapolitan Pizza  |
| Bologna  | Tagliatelle Ragu, Lasagna  |
| Venice  | Squid Ink Pasta, Prosecco, Tiramisu  |
