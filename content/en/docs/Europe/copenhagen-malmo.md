## Recommended Places to Eat

### Grod

Ang moh porridge but it’s really good! Basically oats cooked in milk with toppings of your choice.

### Cocio

It’s not a restaurant, but a brand of chocolate milk that will change your world. You should be able to find it in most supermarkets.

### Gasoline Grill

Not sure if it was the cold but this tasted really good.

## Tips

Copenhagen is a cycling city and it’s really quite an experience exploring the city + outskirts by bike! You should be able to easily find a bicycle rental app which you can use (e.g. Donkey Republic). Otherwise you can check bike shops (they are everywhere!) to see if they have rentals.  

If you cycle you will be able to clear most of the attractions in the city within a day (yes it’s that small).  

Food is extremely expensive in Copenhagen, if you are renting an Airbnb you may want to consider cooking or prepping your own meals.  

The nearby Swedish cities of Malmo & Lund are accessible by train (30-40minutes), good idea to visit as well (although they have even less attractions than Copenhagen).  

Copenhagen is pretty cashless so no need to worry about bringing the local currency with you. Take note that the Danish krone (DKK) is used in Denmark, not the Euro.
