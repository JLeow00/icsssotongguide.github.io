## Tips

Most German cities tend not have gantries for their public transit systems, so it is technically possible to ride for free.  

However, checks by conductors are frequent and fines when caught are high, so don’t test your luck!  

Look out for group day tickets for city public transport which can help you save a lot!  

Germany is a cash-heavy country, and certain establishments do not accept card payment, so it would be great to withdraw/change some Euros in advance!  

While the German Autobahn is known to have no speed limit, be advised that certain sections do have speed limits, especially near cities, so do adhere to them. Also, exercise caution when driving fast.  

Many places are closed on Christmas Day, Boxing Day, New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. so try and avoid visiting during this period  

If you intend to visit the Reichstag Dome, make sure that you register online in advance! Also make sure that you bring photo ID (i.e. passport) for your visit.  

Check out the Ampelmann stores in Berlin for the green traffic light man-themed merchandise.
