Bath is a sprawling city of slightly above a hundred thousand in population and is 97 miles west of London. 

### The Roman Baths

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="You have to see this, it is what you came to Bath for!" />}}

### Bath Abbey

The Abbey Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, commonly known as Bath Abbey, is a parish church of the Church of England and former Benedictine monastery in Bath, Somerset, England.  

Some interesting things to do include following the story of Jesus told across 56 scenes on the Great East Window. Badly damaged during World War II, it was beautifully restored by a father-and-son team in the 1950s.  

You can also pop by the Abbey Shop and enjoy browsing through the selection of Christian books, music and souvenirs.

### Pulteney Bridge

Pulteney Bridge is a bridge over the River Avon in Bath, England. It was completed by 1774, and connected the city with the land of the Pulteney family which it wished to develop.  

It is one of only three bridges in the world lined with shops. The exquisite 18th-century bridge is one of the most admired structures in Bath.

### Christmas Markets (December Only)

Going to Bath in December may be more worth your time, as during that month the Bath Christmas markets are open, so you have something additional to explore besides the baths. Do check online for the exact opening dates. Do expect crowds as well as everyone has the same idea too.  

Itâ€™s a place where the scent of Christmas dances through the air, traditional artisan makers line the streets, and festive cheer lies on every corner.

## Recommended Places to Eat

We recommend one pub in particular to visit during your time there. Fret not, there are also plenty of other extremely good options.

### Raven Ale

The Raven is a traditional old English pub that does good hearty pies and sausages complemented by an ever-changing selection of real ales, ciders or wine. They are a cultural, historical gem of a pub off Queenâ€™s Square in the centre of Bath.  

Specialising in Pies, Ales and Ciders, the Pub is worth a visit.

## Tips

A day trip is really sufficient for this city, as the main highlight is the Roman Baths.  

To get to Bath from London, you can either take the train (Great Western Rail from Paddington) or the coach (National Express from Victoria Coach Station).  

The train is the pricier option, at about Â£40 return, while the coach costs about Â£20 return.  

However, the coach takes twice as long as the train to get to Bath (3h for coach, 1h 30 min for train).  

If you have the time, consider taking the train further down to Bristol, home of the famous Clifton Suspension Bridge.
