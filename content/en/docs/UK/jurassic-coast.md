Old Harry Rocks are three chalk formations, including a stack and a stump, located at Handfast Point, on the Isle of Purbeck in Dorset, southern England.  

They mark the most eastern point of the Jurassic Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  

Further south from Old Harry Rocks along the South West Coast Path is the charming coastal town of Swanage, and beyond that Durlston Country Park and Dancing Ledge.

### Lulworth Cove

Formed by the combined forces of the sea and a river swollen by melting ice at the end of the last Ice Age.  

Lulworth Cove is world famous for its unique geology and landforms including the Lulworth Crumple and Stair Hole.  

From rock-pooling and watersports, to walking, coasteering or just relaxing with an ice cream, this is a must-visit destination on the Dorset Coast.

### Durdle Door

Durdle Door is one of Dorsetâ€™s most photographed and iconic landmarks. It is part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and is an extremely popular beauty spot.

It is located on the Lulworth Estate in south Dorset and is part of the Jurassic Coast.  

The magnificent natural limestone arch was formed when the power of the waves eroded the rock and forged a hole through the middle. The name Durdle is derived from an old English word â€˜thirlâ€™, which means to pierce, bore or drill.

## Recommended Places to Eat

A good trip should be accompanied by good food (and of course, good friends).

### Bankes Arms Inn Pub

The Bankes Arms Inn in Studland, Dorset, could almost set the blueprint for every other traditional country pub.  

Dating back to the 16th century and built from local quarried stone, the pub is surrounded by lush Purbeck countryside. The Bankes Arms has welcoming open fires in winter and a large pub garden for refreshing drinks in summer.

## Tips

The best way to explore the Jurassic Coast is by car as the sights on the coast are not very accessible with public transport.  

We usually rent a car from the Sixt rental station for Heathrow airport, in this way we can avoid the central London congestion charge and hit the highway straightaway.  

The nearest tube station to this Sixt rental station is Hatton Cross.  

Other rental firms are available as well but most of us go for Sixt as their prices a friendlier and they are more friendly towards debit card payments.  

Check their website for the requirements if you are renting with a debit card.
