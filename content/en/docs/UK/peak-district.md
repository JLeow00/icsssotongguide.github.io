## Tips

We used a Car hire from Sixt @ Hatton Cross. It costed Â£266 - inclusive of Young Driver Surcharge, Fuel and Add on costs.  

We stayed at Rockingham Lodge, Market Square, Tideswell, Buxton SK17 8LQ. It was good: clean and tidy with a spacious living room. Many amenities are available and kitchen appliances were very useful. Comfortable bedrooms, washing machine and dryers are available. Very kind owner, good distance from town centre and other towns!
