Certain colleges (yes, this includes the three above) in Cambridge charge entrance fees for visitors. However, if you have a friend who studies at Cambridge, he or she can bring you in for free (and a few other friends, although only up to a certain number).  

However take note that sometimes a college may be closed to all visitors due to private events.

## Recommended Activities

Punting and Formals are some of the more famous activities to do in Cambridge. As always, do stop and have a pint at the famous pubs too.

### Punting

This involves taking a boat ride on the River Cam. To propel and steer the boat, one stands at the back of the boat and pushes a long metal pole against the river bed.  

If you have a friend in Cambridge, he/she may be able to borrow his/her collegeâ€™s punts for some punting. However this is generally not possible during the winter months.  

There are commercial punts that operate throughout winter, however these are rather pricey unless you opt for self-hire.  

Please ensure that you are confident before choosing to self-hire as there is always the risk of falling into the river if you are inexperienced at punting.

### Formals

Most colleges hold formal dinners at regular intervals during term time.  

Generally it is only possible to attend these if your friend at Cambridge invites you for them, so do ask your friend.  

Do ensure that you have formal wear if you are attending these formals!
