Climbing Pen Y Fan is easy if the weather is good.  

However, on the day that we went, the weather was sub-optimal - it was freezing, visability was poor and I literally could not see more than a few metres ahead of me. 

This change in weather happened after we had ascended above a certain altitude, and it was very sudden. I remember seeing that the grass was frozen as we sat down to take a break. On my left, as we climbed the massively-inclined steps - I saw a cliff. Not that the bottom was visable, but I'm certain that a slip would have lead to danger.  

And it wasn't as if the view at the top was worth anything since the weather was bad. On a good day, the view from one of Wales' highest peaks would have been very beautiful. But on that day it was a blur. Blue, icy, frozen, disappointing. The wind was chilly and you could not walk too far without taking a short rest. It didn't help that I had injured my knee from a half-marathon a few weeks prior.  

Yet, the sense of accomplishment was all too amazing. To have made it past that steep ascent in sub-zero conditions.  

But something else awaited us. We realised that we had missed the bus back to Cardiff. So we were forced to wait hours, without signal, in a bus stop at around zero degrees celsius. If we had missed the next bus, which was coming in a few hours, we would have to wait in pitch darkness.  

So we waited. And we waited. We were joined by a group of students at Cardiff University who were hiking as well. Opposite, there was another group of students hiding in another bus stop as it was too cramp.  

I remember the thrill seeing the bus come. We were told by a passing stranger that if we did not flag it in an obvious manner, it would miss us and we would have to wait. I'm sure he would be surprised by how loud we were in getting the bus to stop.  

After a long nap on the bus, we had finally returned to Cardiff. We made a quick dinner of pasta with a glass of wine. Chatted for a while then we called it a day.  

As I lay on the bed, I asked myself - would I do that climb again?  

I sure as hell would.
