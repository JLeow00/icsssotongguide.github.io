# ICSS Travel (GitHub Pages)

This repository contains code used for the Imperial College Singapore Society (ICSS) Travel Website.  

The site is built using the Doks theme inside Hugo, a static-site generator (writen in Go!), and deployed with Netlify.  

View the site [here](https://icsstravel.netlify.app/).

## Developing

Input the following commands into your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/icsstravel/icsstravel.github.io/tree/master
cd icsstravel.github.io
code .
```

To build the site, run:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

Open the server on `localhost`. It should reload live as you edit the code.  

To add / edit content do:

```
cd content
cd en
```

All markdown files are there.
